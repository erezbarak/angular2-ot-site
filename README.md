Ot-site example
========

This is a demo of the ot-site code from the [ng-conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbunztfV5vU) and [related blog post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/creating-components-p3-angular2-directives).  

It's built on top of Pawel Kozlowski's wonderful [ng2-play.ts repo](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play.ts) for Angular 2 bootstrapping.  See below for setup instructions from his README:

## Install

Clone this repo and execute in your favourite shell:

* `npm i -g gulp` to install gulp globally (if you don't have it installed already)
* `npm i` to install local npm dependencies

## Play

After completing installation type in your favourite shell:

* `gulp play` to start a "Hello World" app in a new browser window. App files are observed and will be re-transpiled on each change.

## Dependencies

* ES6 -> ES5 transpilation
    * [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler): ES6 -> ES5 transpilation
* ES6 modules loading
    * [es6-module-loader](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader): ES6 module loader polyfill
    * [systemjs](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs): plugins for the ES6 module loader to handle different module formats - this is mostly needed to load module format generated by traceur
